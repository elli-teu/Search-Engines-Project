## Usage
In order to create an instance of this search engine, complete these steps:

### Elasticsearch
- Install elasticsearch and obtain an API key.

### Indexer
Start by editing the ``setup.py`` file in the ``Index/`` folder, you need to change the following:
* ``ADDRESS :=`` Address to your elastic search server
* ``API_KEY :=`` API key used to authenticate to your elastic search server
* ``DATASET_FOLDER := path`` to your dataset folder, must comply with the spotify specifications (folder structure)
  
Once you have that setup, you can run the ``index_dataset.py`` script, in the ``Index/`` folder, to start indexing your data.
Once that is complete, run ``fix_show_links.py``, in the Index/ folder, to add ``pod_link`` and ``episode_links`` into your database.

The reason why this ``fix_show_links.py`` script exists is because we added this after indexing and have not had the time to incoperate it into the main ``index_dataset.py`` script.


### Web gui
- Change the contents of ``/SearchGUI/setup.py`` to include your API key and elasticsearch host adress.
- Obtain an OpenAI API key and replace the API key in ``/SearchGUI/setup.py`` for the chat client.
- Run the file ``/SearchGUI/app.py``. 
- The website can now be accessed by typing ``http://192.168.1.121:8000`` into the search bar in any web browser, on any device connected to your network.
- In order to access the website from another network, you need to configure your router to forward all traffic on port 8000 to the machine running the ``flask`` server.
